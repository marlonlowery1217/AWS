<h1 style="text-align:center">Cost Effectiveness</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">With Cloud Computing, we're saving! Cost effectiveness plays a determining factor because we only pay for what we use, like a utility bill. 
This also allows for our corporation to perform and peak power, which will increase profit! Moving to the cloud will also eliminate our current
maintenance fee that we pay our vendors, even though we maintain our own equipment. It will also eliminate having to replace this equipment every
4-5 years and spending company time on tasks such as maintenance and upgrades and we all know TIME IS MONEY! Below is a breakdown of the cost analysis
<div id="block1" style="float:left;">
        <u>TRADITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE</u><br>
<br>Initial Purchase - $50,000<br>
<br>Setup (with vendor on site) - $15,000<br>
<br>Deployment (with vendor on site) - $7,000<br>
<br>Maintenance - $5,000 every 3 years, $15,000 in an upgrade year<br>
<br>Employees that Specialize in Equipment - $400,000/yr<br>
<br>TOTAL = $1,302,000 Every 3 Years
    </div>

    <div id="block2" style="float:right;">
