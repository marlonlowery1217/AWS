<title>What Is Cloud Computing?</title>

<body>

<h1 style="text-align:center">What is Cloud Computing?</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">As we all know, our organization <span style="font-style:italic">UGA MIST7500E Final, Inc.</span> is currently using an internal data center.
Unfortunately that puts us in a position where we have to maintain this data and equipment and also takes up space in our environment.
We can mitigate this by moving to cloud computing. This is basically a virtual resource pool where we can house data, storage and networking services.
We would be able to access this data from anywhere within or outside of our infrastructure. This is especially helpful when we're forced to work from home as we were this year due to the pandemic.
Moving to the cloud will allow us to upgrade our infrastructure and continue to stay updated with technological advancements. You might be wondering how it works.
Well, data is stored on physical or virtual servers and maintained by a cloud provider of our choice (more on that in the recommendations and cost analysis). Then from there,
we just access our domain!</p>
